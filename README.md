# Big Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This project focuses on performing big data analytics using a combination of MySQL, Pandas, Hadoop, Sqoop, Hive, and Tableau. The goal is to process and analyze large datasets efficiently, extracting meaningful insights for decision-making.

## Technologies Used

- **MySQL:** For storing and managing structured data.
- **Pandas:** A Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Hadoop:** A distributed storage and processing framework for handling large-scale data.
- **Sqoop:** Used for transferring data between Hadoop and relational databases like MySQL.
- **Hive:** Enables querying and managing large datasets stored in Hadoop.
- **Tableau:** A powerful data visualization tool for creating interactive and insightful dashboards.

## Project Structure

- **Data Collection:** Describes how data was collected, sources, and formats.
- **Data Processing:** Explains the steps taken to clean, preprocess, and prepare the data.
- **Analytics:** Details the analytical methods and techniques applied to extract insights.
- **Visualization:** Demonstrates the visual representation of analytics results using Tableau.
